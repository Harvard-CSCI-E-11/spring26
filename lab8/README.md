Notes on getting this lab to work:

* if you get completely lost, you can factory reset the MEMENTO:

* Be sure your sdcard is formatted FAT32 --- not exFAT.

* Ideally, your SD card should be SDHC (4GB - 32GB).

* If you have a SDXC (64GB+) it probably shipped as an exFAT. It must be reformatted FAT32 to work

* IF you have an older card that is < 4GB, it may work but it will be slow and may draw too much power.
