📸 MEMENTO Camera: Student Quick Start Guide
--------------------------------------------

(This guide was created by Google's Gemini by analyzing the program [camera1.py]([url](https://github.com/Harvard-CSCI-E-11/spring26/blob/main/lab8/camera1.py)).)

The MEMENTO has a "Contextual Menu" system. This means the **Up/Down** buttons change their behavior based on what is selected by the **Left/Right** buttons.

### 🎮 The Navigation Rules

1.  **Select the Category (Left/Right):** Watch the bottom of the screen. Press **Left** or **Right** to move the yellow highlight through categories like `Resolution`, `Effect`, or `Mode`.
2.  **Change the Setting (Up/Down):** Once a category is highlighted, press **Up** or **Down** to change its value (e.g., changing the `Effect` from "None" to "Sepia").

### 🖼️ Camera Modes (The "Mode" Category)

To change how the camera captures images, highlight **Mode** and use **Up/Down** to find these options:

| Mode | What it does | How to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **JPEG** | Standard Photo | Press **Shutter** to snap a photo to the SD card. |
| **GIF** | 15-frame Animation | Hold **Shutter** to record. It saves as an animated `.gif`. |
| **STOP** | Stop-Motion | Press **Shutter** to add a frame. It "onionskins" (blends) the last shot with the live view. |
| **LAPS** | Time-Lapse | Automated photos at a set interval. (See below for controls). |
| **GBOY** | GameBoy Mode | Applies a retro, 4-color dithered effect to your photos. |

* * *

### ⏳ How to Run a Time-Lapse (LAPS)

1.  **Set the Mode:** Use **Left/Right** to highlight **Mode**, then **Up/Down** to select **LAPS**.
2.  **Set the Speed:** Use **Left/Right** to highlight **Timelapse Rate**. Use **Up/Down** to choose the seconds between shots (e.g., 5s, 60s).
3.  **Power Save:** Press **Select** to toggle between **HiPwr** (Screen on) and **LowPwr** (Screen dims to save battery).
4.  **START/STOP:** Press the **OK** button to begin the timer. Press **OK** again to stop.

### ⌨️ Button Cheat Sheet

*   **Shutter (Short Press):** Capture the image or start a recording.
*   **Shutter (Long Press):** Triggers **Autofocus**. Use this if the image looks blurry!
*   **OK Button:** Only used to Start/Stop the **Time-Lapse** clock.
*   **Select Button:** Changes power settings during a Time-Lapse.
*   **Reset (Back of board):** Press once to restart the camera if the code freezes.

* * *

### 💡 Troubleshooting for Students

*   **"Error No SD Card":** Ensure the SD card is clicked into the slot. The camera cannot save files to its internal memory.
*   **"Failed":** This usually means the SD card is full or was removed while the camera was trying to write.
*   **Blurry Photos:** Remember to use a **Long Press** on the shutter to focus before you snap!
