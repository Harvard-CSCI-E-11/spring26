CSCI E-11 Lab #4 - An API server with password hashing
------------------------------------------------------

This lab requires students to:

- [ ] Create a Let's Encrypt TLS certificate
- [ ] Set up lab4.service so that gunicorn runs the flask application `server.main:app`
- [ ] Generate a lab4 `ACCESS_KEY` and `ACCESS_SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] Record the `ACCESS_KEY` and `ACCESS_SECRET_KEY` with the `e11 answer lab4` command
